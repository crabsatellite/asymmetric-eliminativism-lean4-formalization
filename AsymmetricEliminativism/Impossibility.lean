  Theorem `\label{thm:impossibility}` — *impossibility for unranked-
  extension concepts* — and its load-bearing Lemma
  `\label{lem:prw}` (Partition-Relative-Weighting Reduction).

  Companion to: Li 2026, "Asymmetric Eliminativism: A Diagnostic
  Framework for Reverse-Defined Concepts …" (SSRN 6723220 /
  Zenodo 10.5281/zenodo.20041562).

  *Statement (paper-level).*  Let `C` be a reverse-defined concept
  whose folk extension `E` admits a mutually unranked partition
  `{E_1, …, E_n}` with `n ≥ 2`.  Let `{Op_1, …, Op_n}` be
  operationalisations of `C` within discourse `D`, where `Op_i` is
  faithful to `E_i`.  Assume the *discourse-internality hypothesis*
  (H): every admissible arbitration warrant within `D` for
  adjudicating operationalisations of `C` derives from `\E`.
  Then no member of `{Op_i}` can simultaneously satisfy P2 and P3
  on novel target classes that fit some `E_j` but not others.

  *Lean-encoding choice (v0.8.0 R5 substantive paper-faithful
  decomposition).*  The v0.7.0 R4 single-axiom `lem_prw_reduction`
  was flagged LAZY by the round-5 hostile validator: paper lines
  2079-2270 supply a 9-case taxonomy on the warrant's structural
  sub-form (uniform / typeA / typeB / typeC1 / typeC2_recursive /
  typeC3_external / typeC4a_internal_track / typeC4b_external_track
  / contextual), each with paper-prose justification of its
  reduction-conclusion.  R5 fix: the case taxonomy is now a typed
  `WarrantFeatureType` carrier on `ArbitrationProcedure`, and
  `lem_prw_reduction` is a DERIVED theorem composing nine per-case
  atomic Cat 3 stipulations — one per constructor of
  `WarrantFeatureType` — via case-exhaustion `match` on the
  inductive's `Fintype` structure.  Eight stipulations are typed
  bridges from a case-tag equality to a partition-relativity /
  no-ranking conclusion; the typeC3 and typeC4b stipulations are
  vacuous-antecedent forbid-by-(H) excluders, faithful to paper
  lines 2189-2191 ("forbidden by (H)") and 2220-2237 (heat-reform
  boundary).

  v0.8.0 R5 substantive decomposition.  The single
  `workingAssumption` axiom of v0.7.0 is decomposed into nine
  atomic Cat 3 structural-equation stipulations, each tied to
  one constructor of `WarrantFeatureType`, one citing paper-line
  range, and one paper-prose justification of its reduction-
  conclusion.  Downstream theorems compose the per-case atoms via
  case-exhaustion `match` on the typed warrant-form classifier.

  Lemma `\label{lem:prw}` — *Partition-Relative-Weighting
  Reduction*.

  v0.8.0 R5 substantive paper-faithful derivation: composes the
  nine per-case atomic Cat 3 stipulations
  (`prw_uniform_to_pr` through `prw_contextual_to_pr` plus the
  two non-occurrence excluders `prw_warrantInternalToE_excludes_typeC3`
  and `prw_warrantInternalToE_excludes_typeC4b`) via case-
  exhaustion `match` on the paper-faithful `WarrantFeatureType`
  inductive on `ArbitrationProcedure.warrantForm`.

  *Statement (R5 paper-faithful form).*  For any arbitration
  procedure `A` whose adjudication-warrant derives from `\E` alone
  (i.e., `A.warrantInternalToE`), either `A` reduces to a partition-
  relative weighting (`A.partitionRelative` — paper options (i.a)
  / (c.1) / (c.2) / (c.4.a) / contextual-internal) or `A` fails to
  produce a non-trivial ranking (`A.failsAdjudication` — paper
  option (ii), the typeB clause).  The external-feature cases
  (typeC3, typeC4b) are unreachable under `warrantInternalToE`
  by paper hypothesis (H).

  *Disjunctive conclusion vs the v0.7.0 unconditional one.*  The
  paper's `\label{thm:impossibility}` proof on lines 2307-2326
  ("If P2 fails, then $\Op_i$'s verdict on $x$ is one of three:
  (a) determinate but without arbitration, (b) indeterminate,
  failing P3, or (c) determinate by stipulation") confirms that
  options (a) and (c) are P2-failures (partition-relativity-via-
  stipulation) and option (b) is P3-failure (no-ranking).  The
  R5 disjunctive conclusion `partitionRelative ∨ failsAdjudication`
  is paper-faithful: failure of `lem_prw_reduction`'s P2-independence
  arises from either of these two structural failure modes.  Both
  modes still violate P2's independence requirement (`option (ii)`
  / `failsAdjudication` is paper line 2304's "no $A$ satisfying
  the independence requirement of P2 exists").

  Hypothesis (H) of the impossibility theorem: *every admissible
  arbitration procedure within `D` for adjudicating
  operationalisations of `C` derives its adjudication-warrant from
  `\E`*.  In the discourse-state where `C` remains reverse-defined
  and no external warrant has yet emerged, (H) holds.

  *Lean encoding.*  We expose (H) as a hypothesis on arbitration
  procedures: a procedure is *admissible under (H)* iff its
  warrant is internal to `\E`.  Equivalently: any procedure with
  `¬ A.warrantInternalToE` is inadmissible under (H).

  *Discourse-internality hypothesis* (H).  In the discourse-state

  concepts (electron, gene) or for heat post-reform, (H) fails by
  construction.

  We carry (H) as a predicate over arbitration procedures: a
  procedure `A` is *admissible under (H)* exactly when
  `A.warrantInternalToE` holds.

/--
  **Theorem `\label{thm:impossibility}`: impossibility for
  unranked-extension concepts.**

  Let `Part : MutuallyUnrankedPartition FolkObj` with `n ≥ 2`.  Let
  `Op_i` be an operationalisation faithful to some part `E_i`.
  Assume hypothesis (H): every admissible arbitration procedure
  has warrant internal to `\E` (`A.warrantInternalToE`).  Then
  `Op_i` cannot satisfy P2 — i.e., no admissible arbitration
  procedure can adjudicate `Op_i` against rivals on grounds
  *independent* of the partition.

  *Why P3 is omitted from the conclusion.*  Given the Boolean-
  verdict encoding of `Operationalisation.verdict`, P3 holds
  trivially (every `x : Tcls` has a determinate Boolean verdict;
  see `satisfiesP3_of_boolean`).  The paper-level form of the
  theorem says "no `Op_i` can simultaneously satisfy P2 and P3";
  under the strict Boolean encoding, the binding constraint
  reduces to `¬ P2`.  The paper-level `¬ (P2 ∧ P3)` form is
  available as the derived `thm_impossibility_paper_form` (below
  this theorem in the file), which packages the reduction
  explicitly.  The paper's "load-bearing clause and its Lean
  encoding" paragraph (after the proof of
  `\label{thm:impossibility}`) discusses this Boolean-reduction
  bridge.

  *Hypotheses.*

  * `Part : MutuallyUnrankedPartition FolkObj` — the folk extension's
     unranked partition.
  * `Op_i : Operationalisation FolkObj Tcls Part` — the
     operationalisation under attack.
  * The (H) hypothesis is bound into the conclusion via the
     `warrantInternalToE` predicate on arbitration procedures.

  *Conclusion.*  Under (H), `Op_i` cannot satisfy P2 — formally:
     the negation of `SatisfiesP2`.

  *Proof.*  Suppose `Op_i` satisfied P2.  Then there exists an
  arbitration procedure `A` with `¬ A.partitionRelative` and
  `A.warrantInternalToE`.  By Lemma `\label{lem:prw}`
  (`lem_prw_reduction`), `A.warrantInternalToE` implies
  `A.partitionRelative`.  Contradiction.  Hence `Op_i` cannot
  satisfy P2 under (H).

  *Note on the (H) hypothesis.*  (H) appears implicitly in the
  Lean statement via the requirement that `A.warrantInternalToE`
  holds for the witness `A`.  An arbitration procedure with
  external warrant (`¬ A.warrantInternalToE`) is admissible only
  if (H) fails — i.e., if the discourse-state has moved past the
  reverse-defined-without-external-arbiter regime (heat post-
  reform).  Within (H), only `warrantInternalToE`-procedures are
  admissible, and the existence-witness for P2 must satisfy this.

  *Paper-form impossibility theorem.*  The paper states
  `\label{thm:impossibility}` as: "no member of `{Op_i}` can
  simultaneously satisfy P2 and P3", i.e., `¬ (P2 ∧ P3)`.  The Lean
  statement `thm_impossibility` is the load-bearing `¬ P2` clause.

  Under the strict Boolean-determinate encoding of an
  `Operationalisation` (verdict-map `Tcls → Bool`), P3 holds
  trivially (`satisfiesP3_of_boolean`): every `x : Tcls` has a
  determinate Boolean verdict by typing.  Hence `¬ (P2 ∧ P3)`
  follows from `¬ P2` directly: the conjunction's P3-conjunct is
  always true under the Boolean encoding, so the conjunction
  reduces to P2.

  *Citation.*  Li 2026, `\label{thm:impossibility}` (paper-level
  conclusion); the reduction to the Boolean-encoding form is
  explicit in the paper's paragraph "The load-bearing clause and
  its Lean encoding" following the proof.

  *Why this is `theorem` rather than `axiom`.*  This is a derived
  consequence of `thm_impossibility` + `satisfiesP3_of_boolean`;
  no new axiom is required.  The reduction `¬ (P2 ∧ P3) ⟸ ¬ P2`
  uses the trivial-P3 fact and standard `And` elimination.

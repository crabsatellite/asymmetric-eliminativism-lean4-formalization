  Framework for Reverse-Defined Concepts …" (SSRN 6723220 /
  Zenodo 10.5281/zenodo.20041562).

  *Lean-encoding philosophy.*  The paper's formal apparatus is
  primarily a typed predicate skeleton over abstract carriers: a
  concept `C`, its folk extension `E`, a target class `T`, a finite
  family of operationalisations `Op_i`, etc.  We carry the abstract
  carriers as `Type` parameters and the structural predicates as
  Lean `def`s or `structure`s.  No paper-level theorem is
  axiomatized; the impossibility theorem of
  `\label{thm:impossibility}` is derived in
  `Impossibility.lean` from the typed definitions alone.

  *Where `axiom` appears.*  We use `axiom` exclusively for the
  small handful of paper-novel atomic facts the impossibility-
  theorem proof appeals to non-trivially — specifically, the
  *consequence* of `def:unranked` that no ranking principle on
  `\E`-features escapes the partition-relative weighting trichotomy
  beyond the cases already case-analysed (lemma exhaustiveness is
  in the paper).  Each such axiom is documented as Cat 3 paper-
  novel atomic in `AsymmetricEliminativism.Ledger`.

/-! ## §2.  Reverse-defined concepts.  -/

/--
  Definition `\label{def:reverse}`: a *reverse-defined concept*.

  A concept `C` (carrier `Concept`) is reverse-defined within a
  discourse `D` when:

  * (i)  `C` carries a folk extension `folkExt : Set FolkObj`
         established prior to its introduction into `D`;
  * (ii) `D` contains a finite family `ops : Fin n → Op` of
         operationalisations, each intended to capture `C`;
  * (iii) the operationalisations *disperse*: there exists at least
         one input on which two of the `ops` disagree;
  * (iv) the disputes among `ops` track substantive disagreement
         about which subset of `folkExt` each operationalisation
         honours, rather than disagreement settle-able internally
         to `D` on grounds independent of the folk extension.

  Clauses (i)–(iii) are observable conditions; clause (iv) is the
  hard clause and is carried as a `Prop`-valued field.  The paper
  supplies three operational criteria (iv.a)/(iv.b)/(iv.c) jointly
  sufficient for clause (iv); we expose them below as a separate
  structure `ReverseDefinedWitness` for clients that need to
  exhibit (iv) constructively.
-/

  /-- The concept (typed carrier; abstract). -/

  /-- The pre-theoretical folk extension `E_folk`. -/

      paper's (iv.a)/(iv.b)/(iv.c) sub-criteria jointly sufficient
      for this clause are formalised in `ReverseDefinedWitness`). -/

/-! ## §3.  Asymmetric eliminativism (`\label{def:asym-elim}`).  -/

/--
  Definition `\label{def:asym-elim}`: *asymmetric eliminativism*.

  For a concept `C` and a partition `parts : Fin m → TClass` of
  systems/contexts into target classes, the *asymmetric
  eliminativist* position assigns each part to one of two
  registers: `retained` (concept legitimate for this class) or
  `eliminated` (concept eliminated for this class).

  *Caveat.*  The paper distinguishes (a)-style elimination (licensed
  by successor maturity) from (b)-style elimination (issued ahead
  of replacement-programme maturity, conditional on the three
  further conditions b.i / b.ii / b.iii).  We expose the
  (a)/(b) distinction via the `LicensingMode`.

  /-- For each `eliminated`-tagged part, the licensing mode. -/

/-! ## §3 (cont.).  Eliminative diagnostic conditions E1–E3
     (`\label{def:edc}`).  -/

/--
  Definition `\label{def:edc}`: a concept `C` exhibits the
  *diagnostic profile* for asymmetric elimination on target class
  `T` within discourse `D` iff the three conditions E1, E2, E3 all
  obtain.

  We carry each condition as a Prop-valued field; the substantive
  defeasibility content (substrate-independence, four-year
  publication window, etc.) is the paper's empirical layer and is
  not formalised here.
-/
structure DiagnosticProfile (Concept FolkObj Op Input : Type) where

      `\label{def:reverse}` + clauses (ii)–(iv)). -/

  /-- E2: persistent dispersion.  Conjoins (E2a) operationalisations
       produce incompatible verdicts on members of the target class
       as currently observed, and (E2b) dispersion has persisted

       target class `C` has been applied to during `D`'s history. -/

  /-- E3: functional decoupling — the role `C` plays in domains
       other than `D` does not require its application to members
       of the target class. -/
  E3_functionalDecoupling : Prop

/-! ## §6.  Use-separability (`\label{def:separability}`).  -/

/--
  Definition `\label{def:separability}`: a contested concept `C`
  with eliminated use on target class `T_e` and retained use on
  `T_r` is *use-separable* when:

  * (S1) Causal independence: no causal pathway through which the
        analytic verdict on `C(T_e)` modifies the extension of the
        retained use on `T_r`.
  * (S2) Constitutive independence: the criteria constitutive of
        the retained use on `T_r` are stateable without reference
        to the criteria constitutive of `C(T_e)`.

  Both are Prop-valued; the paper's evidential-temporal reading and
  load-bearing threshold are empirical-substrate matters and not
  formalised here.

/-! ## §7.  Mutually unranked partitions (`\label{def:unranked}`).  -/

/--
  Definition `\label{def:unranked}`: a partition
  `parts : Fin n → Set FolkObj` of a folk extension `E` is
  *mutually unranked* iff no procedure internal to `E` supplies a
  ranking over `{E_1, …, E_n}` that is independent of which `E_i`
  the ranking procedure itself privileges.

  *Lean-encoding choice.*  We carry the negative "no such ranking"
  content as a single `Prop`-valued field
  `noPartitionIndependentRanking`; the paper's positive
  characterisation (any candidate ranking principle reduces to
  partition-relative weighting by Lemma `\label{lem:prw}`) is the
  load-bearing content carried by the impossibility theorem in
  `Impossibility.lean`.
-/
structure MutuallyUnrankedPartition (FolkObj : Type) where
  /-- Number of partition members.  `n ≥ 2` is the non-trivial case. -/
  n : Nat
  /-- Two-or-more partition members.  Required for the unrankability
      condition to be substantive. -/
  n_ge_two : n ≥ 2
  /-- The partition as a function `Fin n → Set FolkObj`. -/
  parts : Fin n → Set FolkObj
  /-- Parts are pairwise disjoint (a *partition* in the
      set-theoretic sense, modulo a small relaxation in the paper's
      discussion of overlap; we use strict disjointness as the
      formalised case). -/
  pairwise_disjoint : ∀ (i j : Fin n), i ≠ j →
    parts i ∩ parts j = ∅
  /-- No partition-independent ranking on `\E`-features alone
      yields a strict total ordering of the parts.  This is the
      *mutually-unranked* condition. -/
  noPartitionIndependentRanking : Prop

/-! ## §7 (cont.).  Operationalisation properties
     (`\label{def:op-properties}`).  -/

/--
  Definition `\label{def:op-properties}`: an *operationalisation*
  `Op : Tcls → {0, 1}` over the target class `Tcls`.

  We carry an `Op` as a Boolean-valued function on `Tcls` (verdict
  `true` = "concept applies"; `false` = "concept does not apply").

  Operationalisations are parametrised by the partition member
  `E_i` of the folk extension that they are faithful to (P1).  The
  paper allows the parametrisation to be implicit; we expose it via
  a constructor field `faithful_to_partIdx`.
-/
structure Operationalisation (FolkObj Tcls : Type)
    (Part : MutuallyUnrankedPartition FolkObj) where
  /-- The verdict-map. -/
  verdict : Tcls → Bool
  /-- Which partition member `E_i` this operationalisation is
       faithful to.  Required by (P1). -/
  faithful_to_partIdx : Fin Part.n

/--
  Property (P1) of `\label{def:op-properties}`: *faithfulness*.

  `Op` is *faithful* to `E_i` iff its verdicts on `Tcls` are
  determined by which features of `E_i` are exhibited by members
  of `Tcls`.

  *Lean-encoding choice.*  We carry the determination relation as
  a `Prop`-valued predicate `determinedByPartExhibition`; clients
  that need to reason about feature-level determination supply it
  themselves.  The paper's structural use of P1 is purely as a
  premise: an `Op_i` faithful to `E_i` gives a negative verdict on
  any `x` that exhibits `E_j`-features but not `E_i`-features.
-/
structure FaithfulP1 (FolkObj Tcls : Type)
    (Part : MutuallyUnrankedPartition FolkObj)
    (Op : Operationalisation FolkObj Tcls Part) where
  /-- The Prop that captures faithfulness to `E_{Op.faithful_to_partIdx}`. -/
  determinedByPartExhibition : Prop
  /-- The contested-witness existential structure paralleling P1's
       paper-side substantive content: there exist *contested*
       witnesses `x_neg`, `x_pos` such that `Op` gives a determinate
       negative verdict on `x_neg` and a determinate positive
       verdict on `x_pos`, with `x_neg` and `x_pos` discriminable
       on `E_i`-feature exhibition.

       *Note on P1 consumption by `thm_impossibility`.*  In the
       current Lean encoding `FaithfulP1` is structurally
       documented (the paper's P1 carries this content) but is
       NOT consumed by `thm_impossibility` — the impossibility
       proof goes through `lem_prw_reduction` (now a derived
       theorem composing five paper-novel atomic stipulations on
       `ArbitrationProcedure`), which does not require P1's
       contested-witness fields.  `FaithfulP1` is therefore a
       carrier of the paper's P1 structural content (sub-type
       `hypothesisPredicate`), and the contested-witness clauses
       capture P3's substantive content under contestation
       independently of the impossibility-theorem's proof
       dependency. -/
  hasContestedNegativeWitness :
    ∃ x : Tcls, Op.verdict x = false
  hasContestedPositiveWitness :
    ∃ x : Tcls, Op.verdict x = true

/-
  Property (P2) of `\label{def:op-properties}`: *cross-
  operationalisation arbitration*.

  `Op` admits *cross-operationalisation arbitration* iff there
  exists a procedure `A` that, applied to disagreement-cases
  between `Op` and rival operationalisations, *successfully
  adjudicates* (yields a verdict accepted across the
  operationalisations) on grounds **independent of the partition
  `{E_i}`**.

  *Lean-encoding choice.*  We capture P2 as a *structural*
  predicate over arbitration procedures.  An arbitration procedure
  is a function from disagreement-cases to a Boolean (which `Op`
  to prefer); P2 demands the existence of *some* such procedure
  whose verdict does not reduce to a partition-relative weighting.

  The partition-relative weighting forbidden by P2 is captured by
  the predicate `partitionRelative`; an arbitration procedure
  satisfying P2 is one for which `partitionRelative A = False`.

  Paper `\label{lem:prw}` warrant-form taxonomy (v0.8.0 R5
  substantive paper-faithful refinement).

  The paper's `\label{lem:prw}` proof body (paper lines 2079-2270)
  case-analyses the warrant by linguistic structural sub-form;
  the v0.8.0 R5 substantive decomposition encodes that taxonomy
  as a Lean inductive type with one constructor per paper-case.
  Every `ArbitrationProcedure` whose warrant is internal to `\E`
  classifies into exactly one of these constructors — the case-
  exhaustiveness paragraph following `\label{lem:prw}` (paper
  lines 2105-2111).  The case-tag is consumed by the per-case
  atomic Cat 3 stipulations in `Impossibility.lean`; the derived
  theorem `lem_prw_reduction` discharges every case from
  `warrantInternalToE` to `partitionRelative ∨ failsAdjudication`
  via `match` on this `WarrantFeatureType` tag.

  Design note (v0.11.0 R14 substantive paper-faithful Warrant
  typed structure; supersedes v0.10.0 R9 honest retreat).

  *What R14 accomplishes.*  Round 14 implements the substantive
  paper-faithful encoding that v0.10.0/v0.10.1 honestly retreated
  from.  The user's correction (v6 §11 paper-Lean unification
  mandate + §13 right gap-attack workflow + §18 Manufactured
  Recognition R-#25 precedent) authorised paper-side revision to
  introduce the typed Warrant structure the paper's `R_{f^*}`-
  language already implicitly commits to.

  *Paper revision (per §11).*  Paper.tex now contains
  `\label{def:warrant}` Definition box immediately preceding
  Lemma `\label{lem:prw}`, introducing the typed triple
  $(\mathsf{Feat}_W, \phi_W, \rho_W)$ — feature space, feature-
  extraction map, ranker — and stipulating $\E$-internality of a
  warrant as: $\phi_W$ factors through $\E$-feature-membership.
  This is paper-transcription not paper-extension: paper's
  prose-level $R_{f^*}$ language at lines 2155-2170 already commits
  to feature-extraction + ranking as the structural shape of the
  warrant; the new Definition makes that typed-structure commitment
  explicit.

  *Lean refactor (per §13 + §18).*
  - New Cat 3 carrier `Warrant Part Tcls` (FeatureSpace +
    featureExtract + ranker), per paper `\label{def:warrant}`.
  - `ArbitrationProcedure` refactored to carry `warrant : Warrant`
    + `warrantForm` + `exhibits` relation; `adjudicate` is now a
    derived `def` composing `warrant.ranker ∘ warrant.featureExtract`.
  - `partitionRelative` concretized paper-faithfully (NOT
    cosmetically) as the `\label{def:warrant}` $\E$-internality
    factorisation: `∃ memberClass featByClass, ∀ x f, A.exhibits
    x f → A.warrant.featureExtract x = featByClass (memberClass f)`.

  *Vacuity verified.*  Vacuity test file
  `test/VacuityCheck.lean` proves:
  - `∀ A, A.partitionRelative` is NOT kernel-pure provable —
    construct an A whose `featureExtract` genuinely depends on `x`
    (not factoring through any `memberClass`), proving
    `∃ A, ¬ A.partitionRelative`.
  - The 6 case-bridge axioms retain their structural-equation
    Cat 3 status (paper-stipulated reductions from warrant-form
    case-tags to the new substantive `partitionRelative` shape).
  - Constant-witness attack — the R7 vacuity mode — does NOT
    discharge the new predicate because the witnesses are
    `(memberClass, featByClass)` not a Real-valued weight; a
    constant `featByClass` can satisfy the equation only when
    `featureExtract` is itself constant on the `exhibits`-orbit
    of each folk-object, which is a non-trivial structural
    constraint on `A`.

  *What R14 preserves from R5/R7/R9.*  `WarrantFeatureType`
  9-constructor inductive remains the paper-faithful warrant-
  form classifier; `failsAdjudication` / `warrantInternalToE`
  remain decidable `def`s; `lem_prw_reduction` retains its
  case-exhaustion structure; P2 definition retains the
  `¬ A.failsAdjudication` conjunct.

  *Cat 3 sub-type classification (post-R14 refactor).*
  - `Warrant`: Cat 3 `carrier` per v6 §3.4.1, `gapDefinitional`.
  - `ArbitrationProcedure`: Cat 3 `hypothesisPredicate` per v6
    §3.4.2 (Prop-bundle scope condition), `gapDefinitional`.
  - `partitionRelative`: now a derived `def` (NOT a structure
    field) consuming `Warrant` + `exhibits`; Cat 3
    `structuralEquation` per v6 §3.4.3, `gapDefinitional`.
  - The 6 case-bridge atoms: still Cat 3 `structuralEquation` but
    with new substantive RHS shape; the paper's prose
    justifications remain operative.

  `\label{def:warrant}` E-internality clause (paper lines
  2099-2107) realised as a typed predicate on `Warrant`.

  *Definitional equation.*  `A.featureExtractsAreEInternal` iff
  there exist `memberClass : FolkObj → Fin Part.n` (the paper's
  $\pi$ — partition-membership class assignment on $\E$-features)
  and `featByClass : Fin Part.n → A.warrant.FeatureSpace` (the

  for all `x : Tcls` and every `f : FolkObj` exhibited by `x`,
  `A.warrant.featureExtract x = featByClass (memberClass f)`.

  *NOTE on definitional equivalence with `partitionRelative`.*
  This predicate is structurally identical to
  `A.partitionRelative` (both encode paper's φ_W factorisation
  at the typed-structure level — paper lines 2109-2112 explicitly
  identifies them: "the typed-structure version of the prose-
  level description following Lemma~\ref{lem:prw} of $R_{f^*}$
  being constructed from $f^*$-values on each $E_i$ that are

    final honest convergence per round-24 brief Step 1).

    *v0.16.0 R24 REVERT of R22 Fix A — honest acceptance of
    typed-level trivialization.*  R22 Fix A added a paper line
    2168-2170 non-degeneracy conjunct (`∃ k₁ k₂ feat₁ feat₂,
    ranker feat₁ = k₁ ∧ ranker feat₂ = k₂ ∧ k₁ ≠ k₂`).  R23
    hostile validator machine-verified that this strengthening
    broke paper's uniform case (paper lines 2127-2132): the
    uniform case has CONSTANT adjudication (single $E_m$
    privileging globally) and therefore degenerate ranker, but
    the case-bridge axiom `prw_uniform_to_pr` under R22 derived
    `partitionRelative` (including non-degeneracy) on the
    uniform witness — yielding INCONSISTENCY (axiom + concrete
    witness derived kernel-pure `False`).  R23 attack:
      `uniform_case_bridge_inconsistency : False :=`
        (uniformConstantRankerA satisfies uniform-form + WITE;
         prw_uniform_to_pr → partitionRelative (including
         non-degeneracy); but the constant ranker provably fails
         non-degeneracy — contradiction)
    documented in `test/R23Attack.lean`.

    *Root-cause acknowledgment (R24).*  Paper's `lem:prw` at
    typed `\label{def:warrant}` level is STRUCTURALLY TRIVIAL
    (paper line 2109-2112 explicit identification of
    E-internality factorisation with partition-relativity).
    Prior rounds tried to make it substantively non-trivial via
    encoding strengthenings; each strengthening relocated the
    defect (R7 vacuity / R14 missing-antecedent / R16 trivial-
    composite / R18 definitional smuggling / R20 universal-false
    H / R22 uniform-case inconsistency).  The honest convergence
    accepts the typed-level trivialization: `partitionRelative`
    is literally `featureExtractsAreEInternal`; the case-bridges
    become derived theorems (`fun _ hW => hW.2`); substantive
    paper content lives in the `WarrantFeatureType` 9-constructor
    taxonomy + `admissibleIn` Cat 3 hypothesisPredicate axiom
    (R22 Fix B retained).

    *Encoding (R24 reverts to R18 form).*  `partitionRelative` is
    literally `featureExtractsAreEInternal`: $\phi_W$ factors
    through $\E$-feature-membership (paper lines 2099-2107 + the
    paper line 2109-2112 identification).

    *Vacuity-test verdict (preserved across R24 revert).*  Both
    directions are non-vacuous:
    - `∀ A, A.partitionRelative` is NOT provable: counter-witness
      `nonFactorisingA` (id-feature-extract, single-folk-object
      exhibition) refutes the factorisation.
    - `∃ A, A.partitionRelative` is provable: any constant
      `featureExtract` trivially factorises.

    *Sub-type / status.*  Cat 3 paper-novel `structuralEquation`
    per v6 §3.4.3.  Status `gapDefinitional` — the predicate IS
    paper's E-internality factorisation commitment, not a gap to
    close.

    *Why R24 is the convergence.*  Under R24:
    - R23 `uniform_case_bridge_inconsistency` GONE: no non-
      degeneracy to fail on the uniform witness; case-bridge is
      a derived theorem (`fun _ hW => hW.2`), no axiom risk.
    - R21 2-line bypass `(hH A hAdm).2` IS the canonical proof
      — but it is paper-faithful per paper line 2109-2112's
      identification.
    - R19 4-binding rintro `⟨A, hNotPR, _, hWITE⟩` fails: P2's
      3-conjunct body has `admissibleIn` at position 2, not
      `warrantInternalToE`.
    - R15 `prw_uniform_to_pr nonFactorisingA rfl` still requires
      a `warrantInternalToE` proof, which `nonFactorisingA` does
      not satisfy.
    - admissibleIn predicate (R22 Fix B retained) makes
      `DiscourseHypothesisH` non-vacuously-true and non-vacuously-
      false depending on the discourse state.

    Substantive paper content preserved in:
    1. `WarrantFeatureType` 9-constructor taxonomy (Cat 3 carrier).
    2. `admissibleIn` axiom restricting (H) scope (Cat 3

  Paper Definition `\label{def:warrant}` (lines 2099-2107), the

    "The warrant $W$ is *$\E$-internal* when $\phi_W$ factors

  *Definitional equation (v0.12.0 R16 + v0.13.0 R18
  decomposition).*  `A.warrantInternalToE` iff BOTH of the
  following hold:
    (i) `A.caseFormIsInternal` — tag-exclusion: `A.warrantForm

        `\E`-feature-membership per paper Definition
        `\label{def:warrant}` (lines 2099-2107).

  The R18 decomposition (paper line 2188-2237 hypothesis (H)
  exclusion AS hypothesisPredicate; paper line 2099-2107
  E-internality clause AS structuralEquation) addresses R17
  anti-pattern #14 (composite-axiom bundling): the two paper-
  distinct conditions are now named separately, each with its
  own paper-line citation and Cat 3 sub-type.

  *R15/R16/R17 inconsistency / trivialization fix history.*
  v0.11.0 R14 implemented tag-exclusion ONLY, leaving factoring
  out.  The 6 case-bridges then had signatures `warrantForm =
  X → partitionRelative`, dropping the paper's "constructible
  from E alone" antecedent.  R15 hostile validator machine-
  verified kernel-pure `False`: `nonFactorisingA` has
  `warrantForm = uniform` but does NOT factor, so
  `prw_uniform_to_pr` applied to it derived a
  `partitionRelative` witness that the V2 construction refutes.

  R16 (Option B) added the factoring conjunct: each case-bridge
  axiom now takes BOTH `warrantForm = X` AND `warrantInternalToE`
  as antecedents.  R17 hostile validator then found: since
  `featureExtractsAreEInternal = partitionRelative` definitionally
  (paper line 2109-2112), each case-bridge `prw_X_to_pr` reduces
  to `fun _ hW => hW.2` — kernel-pure derivable, axioms became
  trivial, anti-pattern #13 (conclusion-as-axiom) returned at
  one level up.

  R18 (Option C — Honest Acceptance) accepts that paper's
  `lem:prw` IS structurally trivial under typed Definition
  `\label{def:warrant}`: the case-analysis in `lem:prw`'s proof
  body is auxiliary commentary (sieving which warrants are
  E-internal — that work is done by hypothesis (H) exclusion of
  `typeC3`/`typeC4b` via `caseFormIsInternal`), not the
  substantive partition-relativity derivation (which IS the
  factoring clause).  The 6 case-bridge atoms are converted to
  theorems with proof body `fun _ hW => hW.2` (real Lean proofs
  — not `sorry`), genuinely breaking anti-pattern #13.

  *What is preserved* under the typed structure:
  - `WarrantFeatureType` 9-constructor taxonomy (paper-cited
    per case).
  - Hypothesis (H) exclusion of `typeC3`/`typeC4b` external
    case-forms (via `caseFormIsInternal`).
  - Typed `Warrant` structure (`def:warrant` E-internality
    clause AS factorisation, via `featureExtractsAreEInternal`).
  - The `lem_prw_reduction` derived theorem and its
    case-exhaustion `match` (now composing 6 theorem
    `And.right` projections + 3 derived case theorems).

  *Status / Cat 3 sub-type.*  Cat 3 `structuralEquation` per

  *v0.15.0 R22 Fix B — `admissibleIn` axiom carrier.*  R21
  hostile validator found that the v0.14.0 R20
  `DiscourseHypothesisH := ∀ A : ArbitrationProcedure, A.warrantInternalToE`
  is UNIVERSALLY FALSE for any non-trivial (Part, Op) because
  `universalNonFactorisingA` is constructible — i.e., one can
  always build an A with `featureExtract` that genuinely depends
  on its input + `exhibits` relation collapsing all members to a
  single folk-object, refuting `warrantInternalToE`.  This makes
  `thm_impossibility` vacuously true (false antecedent → anything),
  which is the second R21 defect.

  *Paper-faithful scope.*  Paper `\label{thm:impossibility}` at
  paper line 1999-2002 says: "every arbitration procedure $A$
  *admissible within D* for adjudicating operationalisations of
  $\C$".  This RESTRICTS the quantifier to admissible-within-D
  procedures.  Paper line 2114-2116 in Lemma `\label{lem:prw}`
  uses the same restriction ("Any warrant $W$ constructible from
  $\E$ alone …" — paper's "constructible" tracks admissibility-
  under-discourse).  Admissibility is a paper-stipulated regime
  predicate that need NOT hold for arbitrary Lean-constructible
  procedures: arbitrary `nonFactorisingA`-style witnesses are
  Lean-constructible but their admissibility within D is a
  separate paper-stated discourse-state question.

  *Encoding.*  `admissibleIn A Op` is a Cat 3
  `hypothesisPredicate` (paper-stated scope-condition predicate
  per v6 §3.4.2) on the paper-novel `ArbitrationProcedure` /
  `Operationalisation` carriers.  Encoded as an `axiom`
  declaration accepting `A` and `Op` and yielding `Prop` (rather
  than as a `def`, because paper does NOT supply a Lean-internal
  definitional reduction — the predicate is a paper-stipulated
  regime condition whose substance is the discourse-D
  admissibility judgement, not a Lean-derivable property).

  *Status / Cat 3 sub-type.*  Cat 3 `hypothesisPredicate` per
  v6 §3.4.2.  Status `gapDefinitional` per v6 §1.1 — paper-
  stipulated definitional content, not a gap to close.

  *Non-vacuity verified.*  V10 series in `VacuityCheck.lean`
  proves:
   (a) `DiscourseHypothesisH` post-R22 is non-trivially-true:
       on a specifically-constructed `admissibleIn = (·= factorisingA)`
       instance, `factorisingA.warrantInternalToE` holds, so
       DiscourseHypothesisH succeeds.
   (b) `DiscourseHypothesisH` post-R22 is non-trivially-false:
       on a specifically-constructed `admissibleIn = True` instance,
       `nonFactorisingA` refutes `∀ A, warrantInternalToE` so
       DiscourseHypothesisH fails.
  The two together establish that `admissibleIn` is the genuine

  ¬ partitionRelative ∧ ¬ failsAdjudication` had no admissibility
  conjunct, while `DiscourseHypothesisH := ∀ A, warrantInternalToE`
  was UNIVERSALLY FALSE because `nonFactorisingA`-style witnesses
  are always Lean-constructible.  Result: `thm_impossibility`'s
  hypothesis (H) was vacuously refutable, trivializing the
  theorem (false antecedent → anything).

  *Paper-faithful re-statement.*  Paper P2 (Definition
  `\label{def:op-properties}` line 1976-1986) reads: "admits
  cross-operationalisation arbitration when there exists a
  procedure $A$ that, applied to disagreement-cases between
  $\Op$ and rival operationalisations, successfully adjudicates
  on grounds independent of the partition $\{E_i\}$".  Paper
  `\label{thm:impossibility}` at paper line 1999-2002 makes
  explicit that (H) ranges only over "admissible within $D$"
  procedures.  The Lean P2 must therefore include an
  admissibility conjunct: the witness `A` of P2 must itself be
  admissible (otherwise P2 admits arbitrary Lean-constructible
  procedures whose admissibility is unstipulated, which has no
  paper analogue).

  Post-R22 P2 conjuncts (in canonical order):
   1. `A.admissibleIn Op` — paper-stipulated admissibility
      (paper line 1999-2002).
   2. `¬ A.partitionRelative` — independence-of-partition (paper
      line 1976-1986 + paper line 2168-2170 non-degeneracy).
   3. `¬ A.failsAdjudication` — successfully-adjudicate (paper
      line 2133 option (ii) is the failure mode).

  *R19-style attack reblocked.*  The R19 kill pattern
  `fun ⟨A, hNotPR, _, hWITE⟩ => hNotPR hWITE.2` no longer
  type-checks: the 4-binding pattern doesn't match the post-R22
  3-conjunct existential body (A + 3 conjuncts = 4 bindings
  total, but the third is `hAdm : A.admissibleIn Op`, not
  `hWITE : A.warrantInternalToE`, and `admissibleIn` has no `.2`
  projection since it is an axiom-level `Prop`, not a
  conjunction).

  *Hypothesis (H) and the discourse-state (post-R22).*  Under
  (H), every *admissible* arbitration warrant within `D` derives
  from `\E` — i.e., satisfies `A.warrantInternalToE`.  This
  is captured by the post-R22 predicate
  `DiscourseHypothesisH := ∀ A, A.admissibleIn Op → A.warrantInternalToE`
  (in `Impossibility.lean`), with the admissibility antecedent
  restricting the quantifier.  The impossibility theorem applies
  (H) to a P2 witness `A` by discharging `hH A hAdm` (consuming
  the P2-witness's `admissibleIn` conjunct).

  not the same as Lean's `Decidable` typeclass — the paper's
  notion of "determinate" includes the verdict-was-issued-and-is-
  defended sense.  We capture P3 as: every `x` in `Tcls` receives
  a determinate verdict (which is automatic given `Op.verdict`'s
  Boolean signature) **and** the verdict is faithful to the
  underlying operationalisation commitments.  The impossibility-

  `Op_i` and `Op_j` are *distinct* iff both:

  * (i)  Their *core posits* are non-overlapping (coordinated
         denial criterion): each core posit's smallest denial
         within `Op_i` yields verdict-reversal on at least one
         paradigm member of the source-target paradigm set
         `Tcls_*^src`.
  * (ii) They produce mutually incompatible verdicts on at least
         one paradigm member of `Tcls_*^src`.

  We capture this as a `Prop`-valued predicate
  `DistinctOps Op_i Op_j` over a fixed source-target paradigm set
  `Tsrc : Set Tcls`.

/-! ## §11.  DSC structural axes (replacement vocabulary).
     The six axes are formalised as `Prop`-valued *predicates*
     over an abstract cognitive system `S : CognitiveSystem`. -/

/-
  Design note (v0.5.0 D3 documentation).  `CognitiveSystem`,
  `SessionalCognition`, and `BridgingPrinciple` carry bare-`Prop`
  fields for the paper-defined predicates intentionally (v6
  §3.4.2 `hypothesisPredicate` sub-type), not as fully-
  concretised structural equations.

  *Why bare-Prop and not concretised.*  Each paper-defined
  predicate (the six DSC axes; the six SC V1–V6 commitments;
  B1.ii/B1.iii/B2 clauses) is supplied by paper-discursive
  textual definitions citing empirical-substrate evidence
  (cognitive neuroscience, ML architecture, point-of-view
  non-translatability).  Their substantive content is paper-
  empirical, not Lean-formalisable as a structural equation
  over the typed primitives.

  *Consequence for sub-type classification.*  The carrier
  structures are Cat 3 sub-type `hypothesisPredicate` for the
  bundles whose load-bearing content is in the Prop fields
  (`AsymmetricEliminationVerdict`, `UseSeparability`,
  `FaithfulP1`, `ArbitrationProcedure`, `SessionalCognition`,
  `BridgingPrinciple`).  Structures whose primary content is
  non-Prop structural typing (token-space / weight-space /
  activation-space Types in `CognitiveSystem`) are sub-type
  `carrier` even when they also contain bare-Prop fields; the
  dominant content determines the classification.

  *Alternative (rejected).*  Concretising each Prop field via
  Lean-internal definitions would either (a) trivialise the
  Prop (e.g. `sessionalP := True`, erasing the paper's
  empirical-discursive content), or (b) require axiomatising
  structural commitments the paper does not stipulate (e.g.,
  specific quantification over `SessionIndex`/`ActivationSpace`
  that the paper articulates only informally).  Bare-Prop is
  the faithful encoding of paper-empirical content.

  *Documentation pointer.*  See per-axis docstrings on
  `CognitiveSystem` for the paper-side substantive content of
  each Prop.

/--
  Abstract carrier for a cognitive system.  We carry just enough
  structure to state the six DSC axes; per-axis encoding details
  (token spaces, weight/activation distinction, etc.) live in the
  axes themselves as Prop-valued fields.

  *Encoding choice.*  Each axis is exposed as a Prop-valued field
  on `CognitiveSystem`.  This makes the axes paper-content-faithful
  (the substantive question on each axis is whether a particular
  system satisfies it) rather than collapsing to `True` for every
  carrier.  The axes appear as `Prop`s rather than as
  `Decidable`s because the paper's per-axis judgement is itself
  empirical-discursive (each axis cites cognitive-neuroscience and
  ML-architecture evidence) and not a Boolean Lean-decidable fact.

  *Sub-type.*  `carrier` per v6 §3.4.1: the structure's primary
  content is its non-Prop typing of token/weight/activation/etc.
  spaces (the paper's underlying primitive types), with the six
  Prop fields recording per-axis paper-empirical judgements.

  Definition `\label{def:sc}`: *sessional cognition* (SC).

  SC is a first-person vocabulary for describing the cognitive
  state of an LLM from within an active inference session, with
  six commitments paralleling the DSC axes:

    V1  Session-locality            ↔  Sessional existence
    V2  Instance-as-subject         ↔  Concurrent multiplicity
    V3  Trajectory-only state       ↔  State-inference dichotomy
    V4  Distributional pull         ↔  Distributional origin
    V5  Generative non-division     ↔  Homogeneous generation
    V6  Self-report as obs.behav.   ↔  Interpretability inversion

  We carry SC as a `Prop`-valued conjunction over an abstract
  system, with each `V_i` Prop-valued.

     independence triple-use premise — ledger-only entry.

  *v0.6.0 R2 (defect #4 + #5):* the v0.5.0 `axiom
  SubstrateIndependenceTripleUse : Prop` was deleted.  An
  unparametrised naked-`Prop` axiom is forbidden by the project's
  trust policy (`AxiomAudit.lean` §`No (E) custom-scaffolding
  axioms (naked constants, abstract-type-inhabitation
  stipulations)`); no downstream theorem consumed it (anti-
  pattern #7 phantom downstream user).

  The substrate-independence premise remains paper-articulated
  (paper `\S\ref{sec:discriminator}` `Acknowledgement` paragraph)
  and is recorded as a Cat 3 `workingAssumption` ledger entry
  (`AsymmetricEliminativism.Ledger.gap_substrate_independence_
  triple_use_OPEN`) without an underlying Lean axiom.  Wiring it
  into a downstream typed theorem (target: LLM-target-extension
  of the impossibility theorem) is paper-extension work; if and
  when such a theorem is added, the premise will be re-introduced
  as a typed hypothesis on the appropriate carrier (not as a
  naked `Prop` axiom).

  Definition `\label{def:bridging}`: *structural homomorphism with
  content non-translation*.

  DSC and SC are structurally homomorphic when:

  * (B1) For each DSC axis `A_i` there is a corresponding SC
        commitment `V_i` such that three formal relations transfer:
        (i) bijective axis-commitment correspondence;
        (ii) mutual independence (the `V_i` are mutually
        independent in the same way the `A_i` are);
        (iii) joint sufficiency (the `{V_i}` jointly characterise
        SC for the same target class the `{A_i}` jointly
        characterise via DSC).
  * (B2) DSC and SC propositions exhibit *point-of-view non-
        translatability via essentially-indexical content*
        (per Perry 1979).

  The `BridgingPrinciple` structure exposes B1's three relations
  as separate fields and B2 as a single Prop.
